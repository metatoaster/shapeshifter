Description: Shapeshifter Log to CSV Converter
        =================================
        
        A simple text entry to CSV converter.
        
        This is named shapeshifter because it's named after name of the file
        that was sent to me, `shapeshifter.txt`.  Its content was something
        like this::
        
            #MARKERNAME
            IDENTIFIER-001
            #KEY1
            VALUE1
            #KEY2
            VALUE2
            #KEY3
            VALUE3
            #ENDMARKER
            #MARKERNAME
            IDENTIFIER-002
            ...
            #ENDMARKER
            #ENDQUEUE
        
        Basically I was told I need to extract two fields from it and output it
        as a table.  I thought it was going to be a simple five line script,
        then I realized the party would prefer to have something to click at.
        
        Hence the experiment to toy with TKinter came about.  Basically this is
        a completely untested GUI app for Python, with some sort of purpose that
        came along with it.  Again this started out as a five line script, so
        there are no tests for it, therefore this program doesn't really exist
        until some brave soul decides to write one for it.
